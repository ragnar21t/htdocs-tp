# htdocs-tp
Improved version of: https://github.com/ragnar21t/htdocsXporter

## How to use
You will need to create a file named "path" (without extensions) and write there the folder inside C:\xampp\htdocs\ you want to copy.

For example:
```
myPhpProject
```

^^^ Will copy the entire "myPhpProject" folder recursively to you app location. 

If you already have a folder named "myPhpProject" inside your app location, it will generate "myPhpProject-{random number}".
